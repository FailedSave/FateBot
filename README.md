# FateBot

ASFR Fate Bot for ASFR fans!

The live version might lag behind the changelog since I try to be at least a little cautious not to break anything when deploying.

## Blacklist and Custom Items

The blacklist is a list of strings that will not be used in a material. You can use either commas or semicolons to separate the items. For instance, to exclude all statues and dolls, enter "statue; doll" or "statue, doll" (no quotes).

The custom choices list is added to the list of potential materials. It's likewise semicolon-delimited. To use only custom items, exclude all built-in materials (blacklist the string "a") and include whatever custom materials you want.
